The Frankfort Area Table Tennis Club was started in January of 2015. Our goal
is to give Frankfort area residents a venue for community building,
camaraderie, and a little friendly competition!

We welcome folks of all levels of skill, from the casual competitor to the
serious athlete. We meet at the Memorial Baptist Church, 130 Holmes Street,
every 2nd and 4th Friday, 6-9 pm. Our first meeting will be Friday, January
9th! Please join us!

# Organization of Play

* When a player arrives, he adds himself to the bottom of the list (the pad of
  paper).
* Each player waits his turn.
* When everyone's name above him is crossed off, it is his turn to play. He
  then can choose to do one of the following:

  * ask another idle player to play for fun,
  * challenge another player for a "challenge board" match,
  * ask another idle player if they want to practice for 20 minutes,
  * delay playing (if he's still tired, or wants to wait for someone who is
	already playing).

* If a player delays, it's the next player in line's turn.
* A player who is asked for a "fun" match may decline the invitation.
* All matches are 3-out-of-5 (each game played to 11).
* When a match is over, BOTH players leave the table, return to the front, and
  add their names to the BOTTOM of the waiting list.
* Challenges for the challenge board work as follows:

  * you can only challenge (for the board) someone one or two spaces up from
	you, counting only those players who are present.
  * for example, if you're #4, and #3 is absent, you can challenge #2 or #1.
  * if the higher player wins, there is no change to the board.
  * if the lower player wins, he moves up to the higher players spot, and
	everyone in between moves down one spot (including the loser).
  * the players move the discs on the challenge board themselves (if they're
	not sure sure how to do it, they can ask someone).

* A player who is asked for a "challenge" match cannot decline, unless he has
  already been challenged twice that night (or once already from the same
  person).
* A player who is injured does not have to accept challenges.

## Things to Note

* If you don't show up, you'll gradually creep down - because people below you
  will challenge people above you.
* Players will need to attend regularly if they want to hold their rank.
* Everyone plays equally - winning and losing have no effect on when you
  play... it's first come, first served.
* People can play anyone they want - they are not restricted to playing a
  "winner".
* People really can play anyone they want. Players quickly learn that if they
  really want to play a particular person, they simply wait their turn... then,
  if the person they want to play is busy, they delay until that person is
  available. Thus, you can play anyone you want as soon as you both are
  available and it's one person's turn. 

# General Rules

* Players will conduct themselves in a sportsman-like manner.
* Loud or offensive language will not be tolerated.
* Willful damage to the club's equipment or the facility will not be tolerated.
* Members will cooperate in setting up and taking down the equipment.

  site.
* Table tennis courtesies will be observed.
* A let will be called when a stray ball enters your court.
* No one will unnecessarily pass through a playing area in use.
* The Laws of Table Tennis published by USATT will govern all games.
